# Convolutional Neural Network for Facial Expression Recognition

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for facial expression recognition using the FER dataset. The model is built using Keras and trained on grayscale images of facial expressions.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following layers:
- **Conv2D**: 32 filters, kernel size of (3, 3), ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling2D**: pool size of (2, 2)
- **Conv2D**: 64 filters, kernel size of (3, 3), ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling2D**: pool size of (2, 2)
- **Conv2D**: 128 filters, kernel size of (3, 3), ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling2D**: pool size of (2, 2)
- **Flatten**: Flatten the input
- **Dense**: 128 units, ReLU activation
- **Dropout**: 0.5 dropout rate
- **Dense**: 7 units (number of classes), Softmax activation

## Data Augmentation

The training data is augmented using the following techniques:
- Rescaling
- Shear transformation
- Zoom transformation
- Horizontal flipping

The validation data is only rescaled.

## Training Parameters

- **Image size**: 48x48 pixels
- **Batch size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 20
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 0.0001
- **Loss function**: Categorical crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

## Training and Validation Data

The training and validation data are loaded from the following directories:
- **Training data**: `/content/drive/MyDrive/fer/fer_dataset/train`
- **Validation data**: `/content/drive/MyDrive/fer/fer_dataset/test`

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy keras
    ```
2. Place the training and validation data in the specified directories.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` to train the model.

## Results

The model is trained for 20 epochs. The training and validation accuracy and loss are logged during the training process.
